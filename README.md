## 👩🏽‍💻 About Me

Hi there! I'm **Victoria Ndicu**, a lifelong learner and builder passionate about tech that transforms communities.

I got into software engineering to build tools that **solve real-life African challenges** — from waste management to financial inclusion. What inspires me most is the intersection of **technology, community impact, and sustainability**.

> 💡 I believe that access to secure, decentralized, and intelligent systems can create a more just and equitable future — and I'm here to build it.

## 🎯 My Vision

To **empower communities** through accessible tech — clean, scalable systems that support development in **Africa and beyond**.

That’s why I’m working on:
- Decentralized tools (Web3) for donations and social impact
- Clean-tech platforms like **Taka Techa Waste Solutions**
- Digital payment systems for offline-first communities
- Secure, privacy-conscious applications
